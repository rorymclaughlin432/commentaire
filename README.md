<strong>Introduction</strong>
<br>
YouTube Comments provide insight into users and their opinions. The categories for viewing comments are defined by two categories: Top Comments and Newest First. This is the limit of the comment data analysis on YouTube. Commentaire was created to facilitate an in-depth platform for assessing YouTube comments. It is beneficial for future data statistical analysis research. 
Commentaire is a comment extraction and text mining application developed using R programming. The comment extraction process is the foundation of the software. By observing comments on a more in-depth level, the software can show how users follow trends, how a video increases or decreases in popularity, how valuable sentimentality is and how other videos compare against each other. The aim of the software is to enable the user to have more flexibility and control over a video’s comments.

<strong>Summary</strong>
<br>
YouTube has become one of the most dominant visual and social media platforms on the internet. People comment on videos every day. They discuss features of videos they like and dislike. Comments can provide a wide variety of perspectives and opinions. They formulate a substantial aspect of YouTube. In some respects, comments can help to outline a video’s definition and how effective a video is in stimulating a discussion. However, the YouTube website does not provide a detailed breakdown of comments. Users do not get a full understanding of the comments and the valuable information they possess.
Similarly, analytical websites such as Social Blade, StatSheep and YouTube’s own analytics tool (YouTube Studio) process YouTube video/channel metrics. However, there is no detailed information about comments on any of those websites. They provide subscriber counts and video views but nothing about comments. 
For content creators, it is vital to their success. Comments can help them in listening to their audience and using it as a source of feedback to help grow their fanbase. Similarly, it can be a vital resource for developers and brands. Analysing target audiences and demographics is a fine science. Using polls and questionnaires can be a complex process. YouTube users freely express their opinions on videos, and this is a very accessible format for mining trends for marketing and monetisation. 
Commentaire delivers these facilities and expands on them. It is a refreshing alternative to what is currently available online.
